                Windows 10 has little to offer for advanced users in terms of customisation features. However, here at Widows Suite we aim to change that and allow our users to go above the limitations of the built in Windows 10 customization environment. Currently we offer a single application that is in its beta version and free of charge. The free application called Wallpaper Engine allows users to set custom wallpapers in Windows 10.

            <p>
                Hi, my name is Codie Shannon, and I am the proud owner of Widows Suite. I suffer from a rare neurological condition called Moebius Syndrome which affects my speech and creates a speech barrier for me. Although I have Moebius Syndrome, I have never let this condition hold me back from achieving greatness. I am currently studying for a diploma in Software Development, and I am nearing the end of my first semester. In the future I hope to expand Widows Suite further and develop relationships throughout the Software Development Industry.
